Commercial-grade HTML/website → Android app builder, branded instApped.

## Goals

- Generate Android apps from uploaded HTML/ZIP projects or HTTPS websites.
- Produce reproducible Android projects.
- Build a debug APK for testing.
- Build a release AAB for Google Play distribution.
- Validate package name, version code, target API, manifest, icons, and source layout before building.
- Keep signing credentials outside source control.
- Support a growing catalogue of separately versioned customer apps.

## Current platform baseline

- Target API: 36 (Google Play requirement for new mobile apps and updates beginning August 31, 2026).
- Android Gradle Plugin: 9.4.0.
- Gradle: 9.6.0.
- JDK: 17.
- AndroidX WebKit: 1.17.0.

The exact versions are centralized so the build template can be upgraded deliberately after compatibility testing.

## Repository layout

- `site/` — public website for instapped.com (landing, legal and support pages). Deploy this folder only.
- `factory/` — instApped browser control panel and project-generation logic.
- `android-template/` — clean Android WebView application template.
- `scripts/` — validation utilities.
- `.github/workflows/` — clean-build and release pipelines.
- `cloudflare-worker/` — the build service at api.instapped.com (builds, licenses, payments, master edition).
- `presets/` — importable projects for the Google Play editions of instApped.
- `tests/` — unit and browser tests run in CI.

## Music apps (window.CastelMedia)

Apps built from HTML/ZIP that use `window.CastelMedia` get music support automatically. For any app, including website builds, turn on **Music player** under Permissions in the factory (it sends `"mediaPlayer": true`). Other apps never get the extra permissions.

- **Finds music automatically:** `CastelMedia.scan(cb)` asks for the music permission and returns the device's songs (MediaStore) with URLs the page can play, seek and run through Web Audio.
- **Notification, lock screen and headset controls:** `CastelMedia.update(json)` mirrors what's playing. Controls call `window.CastelMediaEvents(action, value)` (`play`, `pause`, `next`, `prev`, `seek`).
- **Keeps playing in the background** with a media foreground service, and pauses when headphones are unplugged. The WebView handles audio focus for the song itself (pausing for calls), so the service doesn't request it too, because two focus requests make Android pause the song.
- Adds `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` and a `mediaPlayback` service. On Google Play, declare the media-playback foreground service in the app content form.
- Reference app and emulator test: `test-inputs/media/pulse-player.html`, `.github/workflows/media-player-test.yml`.

The full API is documented at the top of `android-template/optional/media/MediaBridge.java`.

## Signing

Never commit a keystore, private signing key, or signing password. Release signing must be injected through GitHub Actions secrets or another secure secret manager.

## Verification rule

A project is **not** considered build-verified because source generation succeeded. It is build-verified only when a clean CI run successfully produces the expected APK/AAB artifacts and the validation job passes.

## Editions

The same factory (`factory/index.html`) runs as four editions. It picks one at start-up; nothing needs a separate copy.

| Edition | Where | How it's detected | Payments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web | create.instapped.com | default | PayMongo checkout → license key |
| Master | `https://api.instapped.com/master` | injected by the build service after owner sign-in | none: everything unlocked |
| Play (no purchases) | Google Play app built from `presets/instapped-play-lite.json` | user agent tag `instApped-Play/lite` | none in the app; license keys bought elsewhere can be entered in Settings |
| Play (Google Play Billing) | Google Play app built from `presets/instapped-play-billing.json` | user agent tag `instApped-Play/billing` | Google Play subscriptions → the same license key |

All editions use the same license keys, so a customer's plan works everywhere.

**Publish only one Play edition.** Two near-identical listings break Google Play's repetitive content policy. Ship the no-purchases edition first, or the Billing edition if you want in-app subscriptions. Both use the package `com.instapped.app` and replace each other as updates.

### Master edition (owner only)

- Open `https://api.instapped.com/master` and sign in with the owner token (`CASTEL_SIGNING_ACCESS_TOKEN`). Sign-in sets a 30-day HttpOnly cookie, so the token never sits in the page.
- The build service serves the factory from the `main` branch (cached for 60 seconds), so master always mirrors the public site. Every feature is unlocked: signed builds, Business tools and test builds, with no ads.
- **Owner tools** (in the menu) show:
  - build service configuration
  - issuing complimentary Pro or Business keys
  - looking up a key's plan, expiry and reference
  - revoking by reference (needs the `LICENSES` KV namespace)
- Master stores projects separately from create.instapped.com because it runs on a different site. To move projects across, export them under Settings → Backup and import them on the other site.
- Sign-in is limited to 8 attempts per 15 minutes per IP. Rotating `LICENSE_SECRET` (or `OWNER_SESSION_SECRET`, if set) signs out every session.

### Building the Play editions

1. In the master edition, go to Settings → Backup → Import and import `presets/instapped-play-lite.json` or `presets/instapped-play-billing.json`.
2. Add the icon, check the listing text, and build a signed AAB.
3. Upload it to Play Console as `com.instapped.app`.

The presets point the app at `https://create.instapped.com/` and set the user agent tag.

### Google Play Billing setup (Billing edition only)

1. In Play Console → Monetize → Subscriptions, create the subscriptions `instapped_pro` and `instapped_business`. Give each one auto-renewing base plans with the IDs `monthly` and `annual`. Free-trial offers are optional; the app buys the base plan.
2. In Google Cloud, create a service account and download a JSON key. In Play Console → Users and permissions, invite the service account with *View financial data* and *Manage orders and subscriptions* for the app.
3. Set the build service secrets and variables:
   - `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (secret): the whole JSON key.
   - `PLAY_PACKAGES` (optional): allowed package names, comma separated. Default `com.instapped.app`.
   - `PLAY_PRODUCTS` (optional): a JSON map of product ID to plan. Default `{"instapped_pro":"pro","instapped_business":"business"}`.
4. The app buys through Google Play. `POST /license/play` then:
   - checks the purchase token with the Google Play Developer API
   - acknowledges it (Google refunds purchases left unacknowledged for 3 days)
   - returns a license valid until the subscription's expiry plus one day
   The app restores purchases quietly on launch, which picks up renewals, reinstalls and new phones.

Customers can also add **Google Play Billing** to their own apps (a Business feature, under Create → Offline & updates). It exposes `window.CastelBilling` (`products`, `purchase`, `restore`, `acknowledge`). Their own server must verify purchases.
